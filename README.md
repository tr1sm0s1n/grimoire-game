## üì¢ About

Wizard Wars is a revolutionary blockchain-powered game that leverages the power of Web3 to create a truly decentralized gaming experience. Each character in the game is represented as a unique NFT, giving players true ownership of their in-game assets.

The peer-to-peer nature of the game eliminates the need for traditional server hosting, allowing friends to host games and play without relying on centralized servers.This decentralized approach not only enhances security but also ensures that the game remains accessible and resilient.

By storing data on both the Stellar and Ethereum blockchains, Wizard Wars combines the strengths of two leading blockchain networks to provide unmatched security and transparency. Players benefit from a more secure, fair, and transparent gaming environment, with verifiable ownership of their assets, the ability to trade or sell characters in a decentralized marketplace, and the potential for interoperability with other blockchain-based games. This player-centric model empowers gamers, fostering a dynamic and robust in-game economy that is driven by the community.
